It is often referred to as the control center of the cell because it contains the cell's genetic material, in the form of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope, which contains nuclear pores that regulate the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus. Within the nucleus, the genetic material is organized into structures called chromosomes, which consist of DNA tightly coiled around proteins called histones. The nucleus also contains a nucleolus, which is involved in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the assembly of ribosomes.\n\nReference: NCERT Biology Class 11, Page 166\n\n Previous year questions:\n (NEET 2023)\n Question: Which organelle is known as the control center of the cell?\nAnswer: The nucleus.\n (NEET\n2022)\n Question: What is the genetic material present in the nucleus?\nAnswer: DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).\n(NEET 2021)\n Question: What is the function of the nucleolus?\n Answer: It is involved in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the assembly of ribosomes. so neetgpt my first Question is \n " + message.text
